# The Vision

KTM is a ticket manager focused on specificity and customization. The basic functionality is to view and manage support tickets/posts with the ability to search through the list. My app takes this to the next level.

# The Features

get full control of which tickets to present with these features:

- âœ… Fully customizable sorting (by every property of the tickets, and ability to choose ascending/descending)
- âœ… Add custom / existing labels to your tickets!
- âœ… Label-based ticket inclusion / exclusion -
  - Ever wanted to only include/exclude tickets based on specific labels? Well, now you can!  
    What makes this feature great is the ability to choose from a pool of all of the existing labels in the tickets database, and it even updates automatically after adding tickets with custom labels / removing all of the tickets with a certain label.  
    On top of that, you can choose if you want to include or exclude the tickets based on your selection of labels and you can also reset the selection.
- âœ… Adding New Tickets - You can add your own tickets!
- âœ… Mark Tickets as Done / Undone
- âœ… Change Viewing Category -
  - You can choose between 4 viewing categories - all tickets, done tickets, undone tickets and
    hidden tickets. They're all self explanatory, but the first three won't show the current hidden tickets. Hidden tickets will show all of the hidden tickets without a done/undone filter.
- âœ… Hide / Show tickets -
  - If there are tickets that you just don't feel like viewing and don't want to mark them as done, don't worry, the solution is simple - you can hide them! This is done by pressing the hide button. If you then want to show that specific ticket - go to hidden tickets and instead of hide you will have a show button. There is also an easy "restore all hidden tickets" option.
- âœ… Delete tickets -

  - If you want the ticket to be gone for good, there's an option for that as well. Just press on the garbage can icon and that's it!

- âœ… Search Tickets -
  - Pick what you want to search by (title/content/author's email) and start typing!
- âœ… Pick your Theme! - There are currently 2 themes available.
